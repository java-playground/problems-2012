# problems-2012
Problem set from 2012

## Usage:
The constructor of the problem's class will print out the result. (not sure how they will do it in competition yet, this is temporary).

Just set the `Main` class to instantiate an object of the correct problem set. i.e.:

```
// Main.java
import probs.prob1.Prob1;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    new Prob1();

  }
}
```

#### File structure.
